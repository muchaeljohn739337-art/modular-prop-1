**Our solution (production-ready):**
- 6 blockchain networks integrated (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Stellar)
- HIPAA-compliant infrastructure with multi-signature wallet security
- Complete facility management suite with real-time bed tracking
- Instant settlement vs traditional 45-90 day cycles

**Traction & Market:**
