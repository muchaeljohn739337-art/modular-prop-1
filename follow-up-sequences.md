## 🎯 DAY 4 FOLLOW-UP - FOR OAK HC/FT (JANUARY 31, 2026)

**Subject:** Re: Advancia Pay Ledger - Healthcare Payments Innovation

**Body:**

Hi Jon,

Following up on my email from Monday about Advancia Pay Ledger - our blockchain payment platform for healthcare facilities.

Given your background with Money2020 and Google Wallet, I thought you'd find it interesting that we're already seeing 40% faster provider onboarding compared to traditional payment processors, while cutting costs by 82%.

Quick update since we first connected:
- Our HIPAA-compliant multi-chain infrastructure is processing test transactions
- We've mapped out the regulatory pathway for healthcare crypto payments
- Early facility feedback shows strong demand for instant settlement capabilities

Would you have 15 minutes next week for a quick demo? I can show you exactly how we're solving the $496B healthcare payment problem.

## 🎯 DAY 10 FOLLOW-UP - IF NO RESPONSE TO DAY 4

**Subject:** Re: Advancia Pay Ledger - Healthcare blockchain payments

**Body:**

Hi Jon,

Checking in again about Advancia Pay Ledger. I know you're busy, but this could be significant for Oak HC/FT given your focus on healthcare fintech.

Since my last email, we've:
- Completed our first successful cross-chain healthcare payment (Ethereum → Polygon)
- Received interest from 3 medical facilities looking to pilot our platform
- Validated our 82% cost reduction claim with real healthcare payment data

The healthcare payments space is moving quickly with stablecoin adoption - we're positioning ourselves to be the "Stripe for Healthcare" in this new paradigm.

Would 20 minutes work for a call next week? I'd love to get your perspective on the opportunity.

## 🎯 DAY 30 FOLLOW-UP - FINAL FOLLOW-UP

Final follow-up about Advancia Pay Ledger. I understand timing might not be right, but wanted to share that we're gaining traction:

- Pilot program launching with 2 medical facilities next month
- Pipeline of $2.4M in annual transaction volume from early adopters

If Oak HC/FT is interested in the healthcare blockchain payments space, I'd still value your perspective. If not, I'd appreciate any introductions to other investors who might be a better fit.
