## 🚨 TOP 5 OBJECTIONS + RESPONSES

### 1. "Why would hospitals use crypto?"
**Response:** "They won't even know they're using it. We handle all blockchain complexity - they just see faster settlement and lower costs. Think Stripe for healthcare."

### 2. "What if Stripe builds this?"
**Response:** "Healthcare is 5% of Stripe's business. We're 100% focused on healthcare payments with deep regulatory expertise. Stripe typically acquires rather than builds in specialized verticals."

### 3. "Your valuation seems high"
**Response:** "We're production-ready with 82% cost reduction targeting $496B market. Our 5-year projections show $78M revenue at 75% margins. What range did you have in mind?"
