## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Keep Secrets Secure

```bash
# Never commit secrets to git
# Always use wrangler secret put
# Rotate secrets regularly
```

### 2. Validate Input

The worker already includes:
- Email address validation
- Spam keyword detection
- Block list checking

### 3. Rate Limiting

Add rate limiting for webhook notifications:

```javascript
// In worker code
const rateLimiter = {
  lastNotification: {},
  minInterval: 60000, // 1 minute
  
  shouldNotify(email) {
    const now = Date.now();
    const last = this.lastNotification[email] || 0;
    if (now - last < this.minInterval) {
      return false;
    }
    this.lastNotification[email] = now;
    return true;
  }
};
```

### 4. Monitor Logs

```bash
# Set up alerts in Cloudflare dashboard
# Alert on error rate > 5%
# Alert on unusual traffic patterns
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Receiving Emails

```bash
# Check worker is deployed
wrangler deployments list

# Check email routing rules
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID}/email/routing/rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}"

# Verify worker is connected to email routing
# Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard → Email → Email Workers
```

### Emails Not Forwarding

```bash
# Check destination email is verified
# Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard → Email → Destination addresses

# Check worker logs for errors
wrangler tail --status error

# Verify destinationEmail in worker code
```

### Webhooks Not Working

```bash
# Test webhook URL manually
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"Test message"}'

# Check worker logs
wrangler tail

# Verify secret is set
wrangler secret list
```

### Auto-Responder Not Sending

```bash
# Check business hours configuration
# Verify email is to support@
# Check worker logs for errors
wrangler tail

# Test outside business hours
```

## 🚀 Advanced Customizations

### Add Database Logging

```javascript
// Store email data in D1 database
if (env.DB) {
  await env.DB.prepare(
    'INSERT INTO emails (timestamp, from_email, to_email, subject) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)'
  ).bind(
    new Date().toISOString(),
    message.from,
    emailTo,
    subject
  ).run();
}
```

### Add AI Spam Detection

```javascript
// Use Cloudflare AI to detect spam
if (env.AI) {
  const result = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8', {
    prompt: `Is this email spam? Subject: ${subject}. Reply with YES or NO.`
  });
  
  if (result.response.includes('YES')) {
    message.setReject("Detected as spam by AI");
    return;
  }
}
```

### Add Email Parsing

```javascript
// Parse email content
const emailContent = await new Response(message.raw).text();

// Extract links
const links = emailContent.match(/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/g) || [];

// Check for phishing
const suspiciousDomains = ['bit.ly', 'tinyurl.com'];
const hasPhishing = links.some(link => 
  suspiciousDomains.some(domain => link.includes(domain))
);
```
