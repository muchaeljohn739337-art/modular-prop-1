   GOOD: "Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this Tuesday or Wednesday?"
   ```

## 📬 FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

### **Follow-Up Timeline:**
- **Day 3-4:** First follow-up (if no response to initial email)
- **Day 7:** Second follow-up with new information
- **Day 14:** Final follow-up with graceful exit

### **First Follow-Up Template (Day 3-4):**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my email from [day]. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

We're making progress on our $1.5M seed round and I'd still love to get [Firm Name] involved.

**One-line reminder:** Cryptocurrency payment platform for healthcare facilities - 
$68B TAM, production-ready, 6 blockchain networks, 0.5% transaction fees.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick demo this week?

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

### **Second Follow-Up Template (Day 7):**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

One more follow-up - since my last email we've [NEW UPDATE: e.g., "signed our 
first pilot customer" or "hit a key technical milestone" or "featured in [publication]"].

I've attached our one-pager with key metrics and projections.

Still interested in a brief demo? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

If the timing isn't right, I completely understand - just let me know and I won't 
follow up further.

Best,
[Your Name]

[ATTACH: Advancia-Investor-One-Pager.pdf]
```

### **Final Follow-Up Template (Day 14):**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject] - Final follow-up

Hi [First Name],

This is my final follow-up - I don't want to clog your inbox!

If [Firm Name] isn't the right fit or timing isn't right, no worries at all. 

But if you're still interested, I'd love to connect for 15 minutes. Otherwise, 
I'll assume it's a pass and won't reach out again.

Either way, thanks for your consideration!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ Always include NEW information in follow-ups
- ✅ Keep shorter than original email
- ✅ Give them an easy out ("if timing isn't right...")
- ✅ Never follow up more than 3 times
- ✅ Attach one-pager on 2nd follow-up only (not first email)

## 📞 WHEN YOU GET A RESPONSE

### **Response Type 1: "Send me your deck"**
This can be a brush-off or genuine interest. Push for a call first:

```
Hi [First Name],

Great to hear from you! I'd be happy to send over our deck.

I find it's usually more efficient to do a quick 15-minute call first so I can 
address your specific questions and make sure we're a fit. Do you have any time 
this week?

If not, I'll send the deck now and we can schedule a follow-up call after you review.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Then send:**
1. Pitch deck (PDF)
2. One-pager (PDF)
3. Link to demo video (if available)

### **Response Type 2: "Yes, let's set up a call"**
Great! Schedule immediately:

```
Hi [First Name],

Excellent! I'm flexible on timing. Here are a few options:
- [Day], [Date] at [Time] or [Time]
- [Day], [Date] at [Time] or [Time]

Let me know what works best and I'll send a calendar invite.

Looking forward to showing you what we've built!

[Your Name]
```

**Immediately after call is scheduled:**
- Send calendar invite with Zoom/Google Meet link
- Include one-pager PDF as attachment in calendar invite
- Send confirmation email with agenda

### **Response Type 3: "Not right now, but stay in touch"**
This is actually good! Keep them warm:

```
Hi [First Name],

Completely understand - thanks for being transparent about the timing.

I'll keep you updated on our progress. Would it be okay if I reach out in 
[3 months / when we hit $X milestone / after we close this round]?

Also, if you know anyone who might be a better fit at this stage, I'd 
appreciate any intros!

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Add to spreadsheet as "Pass - Timing" and set reminder to follow up later**

### **Response Type 4: "This isn't a fit for us"**
Gracefully accept and ask for referrals:

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the quick response - I appreciate you being straightforward.

If you think of anyone who might be a better fit for a healthcare crypto 
infrastructure play, I'd be grateful for an intro.

Best of luck with your portfolio!

[Your Name]
```

**Mark as "Pass" in spreadsheet and move on**

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### **Email Best Practices:**
1. ✅ **Proofread obsessively** - Typos kill credibility
2. ✅ **Keep under 200 words** for cold emails
3. ✅ **One clear CTA** - Don't give multiple options
4. ✅ **Mobile-friendly** - 50% of investors read on phones
5. ✅ **No attachments** on first cold email (hurts deliverability)

### **Research Shortcuts:**
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator (if available) to find investor backgrounds
- Check Crunchbase for recent investments and check sizes
- Google "[firm name] + seed investments" for portfolio patterns
- Twitter search: "[investor name] healthcare OR crypto" for their takes

### **Mindset Reminders:**
- 🧠 Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"
- 🧠 Rejection is data, not personal
- 🧠 Focus on volume + quality (both matter)
- 🧠 Your goal this week: Get 1-2 responses. That's success!

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't send emails at 2 AM (shows poor judgment)
- ❌ Don't follow up without new information
- ❌ Don't CC multiple partners at same firm (they'll all ignore)
- ❌ Don't say "we have no competition" (shows naivety)
- ❌ Don't mass BCC investors (they can sometimes tell)
